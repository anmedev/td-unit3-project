## Description
This repository contains my code for the Unit 3 project in the Treehouse Techdegree curriculum. This project is an interactive form where a user can register for a full-stack tech conference. The user is able to input their personal information, select the activities they are interested in, and pay a registration fee. Should a user input their information incorrectly or miss a step in the registration process, visual validation errors will display on the form.

## Known Bugs
